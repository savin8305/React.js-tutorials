  ## What is CDN 
  `A CDN (Content Delivery Network) in React JS is a system of servers that are distributed around the globe to provide fast delivery of static assets, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files, to users. When you use a CDN to serve your React app, the server closest to the user will be used to deliver the content, which helps reduce latency and improve performance. Additionally, some popular CDNs for hosting React applications include Cloudflare, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and AWS S3.`
